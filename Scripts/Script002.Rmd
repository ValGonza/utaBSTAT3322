## A sample problem
Suppose a family of four goes to a fate-food hambeurger resturarnt and places the following order.

Food item       | Quantity |  Price  
----------------|----------|---------
Hamburger       |   3     |  $3.75 
Delux Cheeseburger | 1 | $ 5.75  
French fries    |    2      | $1.75
Onion rings     |   1   |     $2.00 
Soft drings     |   2   |     $0.99
Milkshake       |   1   | $3.25  
Beer            |   1   | $4.75

We will investigate how to compute the order total using R and then compute the average cost per person.  

## Vector

R operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the numeric vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of numbers.  To set up the numeric quantites given above we duse the following statements:

```{r,vector}

quantity <- c( 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1 )
quantity

price <- c( 3.75, 5.75, 1.75 , 2.00, 0.99, 3.25, 4.75  )
price 
```

  
This is an assignment statement using the function c() which in this context can take an arbitrary number of vector arguments and whose value is a vector got by concatenating its arguments end to end.  
We can also create character vecors as follows:

```{r,CharacterVectors}
foodItem <- c( "Hamburger", 
               "Delux Cheesesburger",
               "French Fires",
               "Onion Rings",
               "Medium Soft Srink",
               "Milkshake",
               "Beer" )
foodItem

```
  
## Acessing one or more elements of a vector

```{r}

foodItem[3]        # Retirteve the the thrid fooditem on the order
foodItem[ 1:2 ]    # Retreive the first two items in the order

```

## computing the length of a vector
```{r,Length}

length(foodItem)
length( quantity)
length( price )

```

## Elementwise arthimetic
Vector arthimetic proceeds in an element-wise manner:
```{r,VectorArthimetic}
extension <-quantity * price
extension
```

## A single number times a vector
```{r,MoreVectorArthimetic}
2 * quantity
round( 1.10 * price, 2 )
```

## Creating a data frame
```{r,dataframe}
Order <- data.frame(  foodItem, quantity, price  )
Order

```
  
 # Clear memory
 
 
```{r,remove}
ls()      # List environment  contents        # List objecs
rm( foodItenm, quantity, price, extension )   # Remove objects
ls()                                          # Relist objects

```

## Acessing a vector in data.frame

```{r,AcessingDataFrame}

Order$quantity
with( Order, quantity)
#
Order$Price
with( Order, price )
#
Order$quantity * Order$price
with( Order, quantity * price )
#
ybar <- with( Order, sum( quantity * price )) / 4
ybar

```
